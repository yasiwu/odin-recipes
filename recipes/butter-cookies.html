        <h3><strong><em>Description</em></strong></h3>
        <p>Light buttery cookies that you will can't stop eating. One of Hong Kong's favorite snack.</p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200g cake flour</li>
            <li>130g melted butter</li>
            <li>35g caster sugar</li>
            <li>65g icing sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg (50g), whisked</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 190C (375F).</li>
            <li>Cut butter into cubes and allow to soften at room temperature. If time is limited, here is a quickest way to soften butter. Melt butter in microwave at high-medium power for 10 seconds or so, then transfer to freezer for a few minutes. When the butter begins to be frozen again and thickens, it’s ready to use. If not, put it back to freezer for more minutes.</li>
            <li>Cream butter with an electric mixer over medium speed until smooth. Add caster sugar and icing sugar, continue to cream until fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add one-third of the whisked egg into the butter mixture at a time. Stir and combine well between adding egg each time, the volume increases and colour lightens.</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla essence and combine well.</li>
            <li>Sift flour into the egg mixture. Use a spatula to combine all ingredients (picture 6). Don’t over stir, just incorporate the flour into the mixture. Transfer the batter into an icing bag (picture 7). Pipe the batter on a lined baking tray with baking paper, in 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) circles, that’s about 1 tablespoon each of batter, evenly spaced 1.5-inch apart (picture 8). Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 13 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack completely. Store in an air-tight container.</li>
        </ol>
