        <p>Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). ... The dish is made by stacking lasagna sheets on top of each other with meats, vegetables, cheeses, and tomato sauce between.</p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>

            <li>salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (15 oz) package whole milk ricotta</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups shredded mozzerella, divided</li>

            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.

            <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles, tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.*</li>
            <li>Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling. Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until top is browned in spots.</li>
